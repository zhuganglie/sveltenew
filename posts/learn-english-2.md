<dt>Look at the picture and write in about 100 words your thoughts about it.</dt>
<dd>

With recent development of artificial intelligence, it is quite likely that robots will, as you can see in the picture, enter workplaces and work together with human workers. Some people are optimistic about the intelligent robotisation of workplace. They argue that  with robots taking over the jobs that are repetitive and physically heavy, human can achieve higher job satisfaction by focusing on work that are more meaningful and worthwhile. I disagree with this overly optimistic outlook. I tend to believe that robotisation will significantly decrease human workers' job satisfaction.

In the first place, it is not necessarily true that human workers will be involved in more meaningful work after the introduction of robots. For instance, the work of taxi drivers in a city of China was partly outsourced to robots with introduction of autonomous cars. Some of the drivers were transferred to the position of dispatcher. Compared to driving, this new work sounds more exciting in the sense that it is not physically tiring and involves larger scale decision-making. However, a field research on those taxi drivers revealed that they were feeling deprived of meaningful work. Instead of being able to respond to passengers' request directly, the newly appointed dispatchers were now only serving passengers indirectly. The feedback that they were no longer able to see the passengers' satisfied smiles meant that they felt a loss of meaningful work after the introduction of robots. 

In the second place, the introduction of robots will make workplaces lack of social connectedness. Sociological research has confirmed that a sense of relatedness at work is positively linked to one's job satisfaction. Cooperating with co-workers, feeling accepted by colleagues, being guided or mentored lead human workers to believe that their work is meaningful and worthwhile. Without a weakened sense of connectedness, human workers will soon find their work is not worthwhile at all.

To conclude, the impact of workplace robotisation could be as negative. More scientific research are needed to explore possible ways to help human workers to improve job satisfaction while working with robots.

<dt>If you had a choice what job would you like to do in future? Write in about 80-100 words.</dt>
<dd>

I would like to be a web developer in future if I have a choice.

Web developers can either work independently as freelancers or work with company teams to create websites. The work that a web developer usually does includes front-end development, back-end development, and website maintenance. Front-end development is to design website and produce contents. Back-end development is to write code and make the features of a website function. Website maintenance is to maintain functions, fix bugs, and manage database of a website. To be a web developer, you must be very proficient in mark-up languages,  programming languages, as well as  popular frameworks built upon these languages. As the technical stacks for web development evolves very fast, you need to keep learning so as to stay relevant.

The reason why I like to be a web developer is that it is quite easy to land a job with decent pay. According to statistics, the average salary for a web developer is ranked the highest among other technology-related jobs. And, it takes only 1 month to land a web development job, five months shorter than others.

<dt>Talk about the development of the computer and Internet revolution through the years.</dt>
<dd>


There is a long history of using devices to aid in counting or computing. In 500BC, abacus calculator was developed to do simple counting as well as arithmetic calculations. Although abacus techniques were well developed to do complex calculations, it remained a simple and primitive "counting device". As it relied solely on manual operation, it was unable to do logarithm calculation.

In 1821, the first mechanical calculator was invented by Charles Babbage, a British mathematician who is later known as "Father of Modern Computer". Unlike abacus calculator, the steam-driven calculating machines were capable of solving any mathematic problem even storing information as permanent memory. 

The first electric computer was developed in 1939. Two years later, the first fully automatic and digital computer was created by German engineer Konrad Zuse. The digital computers can be used for routine jobs because they are equipped with the speed of electronic and the ability to be programmed.

The development of electric computer has greatly accelerated the revolution of more information technology. In 1971, Raymond Tomlinson invented email. This invention is revolutionary because email made it possible for different computers to exchange message with each other.

Two years after the first email was sent in 1971, the first computer with graphical user interface, keyboard, and mouse was invented. This introduction of graphical interface greatly simplified the way of people interacting with computer. People without knowledge about programming can operate computer.

In 1973, the first personal computer was introduced. As personal computer was much smaller in size and much cheaper in price, it was soon popularised for mass use.

In 1983, ten years after the introduction of personal computer, global internet was created. As interest in networking grew, web technology such as W3 and web browsers developed rapidly. In 1994, world wide web surfing began.

<dt>Write a short story based on the sequence of events in the chart</dt>
<dd>

A week ago, I was on my newly purchased motorcycle, riding along  on the twist road at the shore of Gulang island in Amoy city. Suddenly, a drunk-driving car came toward me at a tremendous speed. Scared by the situation, I flusteredly accelerated the bike instead of applying the handbrake. This made me feel panicky and breathless. To avoid colliding with the car, I hurried to turn the bike left and consequently ran into the sea.

I did not know how to swim and almost drown in water. When I struggled to bob my head above the water, I noticed that something big was swimming toward me. It had a dorsal fin on its back, two pectoral fins on its sides, and a tail. "A shark!" I gave a yell of fear and desperately kicked my legs in water. After a few seconds,  my legs tired and I started sinking. When I could not hold my breath, the water rushed in. I thought I was about to die. At this very moment, something suddenly hit my back. I felt myself being pushed to the surface of the water and toward a boat. 

When I recovered from the panic, a rescuer pointed to a bottlenose dolphin and told me, "It was she who saved your life." The bottlenose dolphin was swimming away from the boat. She wasn't afraid of swimmers around and kept returning to the sea. "Dolphins and human being are friends. We should protect them like what they did for us." I said to the reporter who interviewed me after the accident.

<dt>What do you think about social media? Which sites and apps do you use?</dt>
<dd>

I tend to think that social media has both positive and negative impact on society. 

On positive side, social media has provided more convenient means for people to build and maintain relationships. With social media, we can make friends even with people we never meet in person. Moreover, social media has democratised media by giving everyone an equal voice. You can write anything and anyone has the chance to read it or view it. Social media has also revolutsonarized the way people do business. By interacting with their consumers on  social networks, businesses are able to learn how to target consumers with the right products and services at the right time of need. Lastly, social media has provided people with more and quicker access to educational resources than ever before. People can learn almost anything they like to learn by searching "how-to" on social media like Youtube.

There are, however, some negative effects on society. Social media can produce fake news or other misleading contents like one-sided story, biased opinion, filtered pictures. In addition, social media can be addictive and a source of distraction. Spending too much time on social media may not only reduce our productivity but also weaken our ability to appreciate the art of face-to-face communication.

<dt>When life's problems seem overwhelming, look around and see what other people are dealing with. You might just consider yourself fortunate.</dt>
<dd>

I agree with this statement. Life is not easy and it is not easy for everybody. So, when we are frustrated by life issues, we do not have to feel like it is the end of the day. For one reason, we might not be the one who live the most miserable in this world. Take my friend for example. He he failed to pass his qualification examination and thus felt depressed. But when he went back to his hometown and saw that his child friend was suffering from cancer, he suddenly realised that he was so lucky. At least, he still had a dream for tomorrow. 

For another reason, no problem is unsolvable. We can take a positive approach and see what we can do to solve the problem. By learning to solve problems, we can learn new life skills and improve to be more indomitable. 

Lastly, even if the problem we have is deadly, we still can choose to face it with smile. You may ask how we can keep smiling while we are going to die? It is because the meaning of death is that we will have no problem any more.

<dt>My anger issues almost screwed up my life.</dt>
<dd>


Anger is a natural response to threat, danger or other unpleasant stimuli. However, it could become a problem if you have trouble in controlling your anger. Anger can cause you to say or do things you regret. It is not rare that young couple got divorced because the husband lost temper and slapped his wife.

Anger issues can be caused by many things --- too much stress, life issues, family strife, unfair treatment, and more. When faced with these aggravating situations, there are some tactics that help you to manage your anger. A first tactic is to take deep breaths and count to ten before you say a word. Breathing in fresh air can help to reduce the intensity of your anger. A second tactic is to walk away from the situation and have a brisk walk around the block. This can give you time and space to think and calm down. When having a heating argument, it is helpful to just listen to what others have to say instead of jumping into a conclusion that will get yourself irritated. If you are in a stressful situation, you can distract yourself from anger by taking a shower, seeing a film, or doing something you like to do. In addition, engaging in exercises or sports can help consume some of the energy that may otherwise have escalated into open aggression. Last but not least, when you are frustrated by life problems, you can focus on solutions so as to avoid being trapped by negative mood.

<dt>Talk about a time when you used a persuasion tactic effectively. How do you feel about it? What do you think are some bad persuasion methods? What makes them bad?</dt>
<dd>

My company invetested considerable resources into branding and marketing. However, the sales did not increase as expected. I believed that the sales would be improved if we could upskill our sales associates. I thus decided to persuade the management team to run a training program for the front-line sales staff. 

You know, it was not easy to convince the management as they had a number of concerns about the training program. Some questioned the usefulness of training. Others feared that it might not be able to arrange sales associates to attend training session that would last 2-3 hours per day. Still others worried that the employees might think they are more employable and jump ship after training.

To clear their concerns, I did a field research and wrote up a proposal based on the research finding. I showed to the management that the branding effort was successful because the number of daily walk-in customers had increased significantly. The reason why sales revenue remained stagnant was because the front-line workers were lack of selling skills and product knowledge and thus unable to convert walk-in customers into actual buyers. To have better sales performance, it was necessary to fill up this competency gap.

In order to show how much difference a training program could make, I divided the employees into two groups and compared the sales performance of the well-trained group with that of the un-trained group. After that, I suggested to take a bite-sized approach to organize the training sessions, so that the schedule of training sessions would not affect the daily operation of retail outlets.

By appealing to the power of information and logic, I finally twisted the management's arm. I felt so happy when the management approved my proposal in the end.

<dt>Discuss the following questions:

- Do you think it's ok to eat lots of chocolate? Why or why not?<br />
- In your opinion, why do people love eating chocolates?<br />
- What's your favourite chocolate brand? Why do you like it?<br />
  
</dt>
<dd>

I think it's ok to take chocolate regularly because chocolate is found to have a range of health effects. A study  suggested that regular consumption of chocolate may support cardiovascular health by  lowering cholesterol and improving blood pressure. Another study confirmed that chocolate can induce positive effects on blood flow, and thus able to help keep brain healthy and reduce memory decline. There is also evidence that consuming chocolate can help lower the risk of developing heart disease. 

However, it is not recommended to eat too much chocolate. Too much chocolate consumption, according to a scientific research, may increase the risk of kidney stones and diabetes which later causes obesity. In addition, eating too much chocolate may have negative digestive side effects.

In my opinion, people love eating chocolate for a number of reasons. First, chocolate can stimulate feelings of pleasure when it melts on your tongue. Chocolate lovers often describe this sensation of smoothness as "a true moment of ecstasy". Second, chocolate contains a number of interesting psychoactive chemicals, which can improve your mood. Actually, many chocolate lovers consider chocolate as a comfort food and eat it as a mood booster. Third, chocolate is associated with love and romance. Women are habitually given chocolate as birthday and Valentines day presents. Chocolate makes women feel loved, cared for, and pampered. This could explain why women love chocolate more often than men do. 

The chocolate brand I like most is Dove. I like it because it tasteful. It is sweet but not that sweet. When it melts in your mouth, it gives a thick taste of chocolate instantly. And, the feeling of smoothness is really subtle and exhilarating. I like it also because it is made of dark chocolate, which is considered as less sugar and more healthy.

<dt>The greatest wealth is health.</dt>
<dd>
I totally agree with this statement. First of all, healthy people will save a lot of money on medical expenses. On the contrary, the people who are not healthy will have to spend their hard-earned money on seeing doctor or having medical treatment. Secondly, people in good health condition are able to stay productive for longer time than those who are not good in health condition. Therefore, it is not surprising that healthier people can earn more as well. Moreover, healthy people can live longer and thus able to keep earning money as long as they would like to. In addition, when people have a higher level of well-being, they are likely to have a can-do attitude, which will enable them to succeed in what they are aspired to do. To conclude, health will make your life wealthier and more cheerful. Let's make some change and live a healthier life style.

<dd>

Life is beautiful. If you want to enjoy the happy life, you must manage your lifestyle so as to stay healthy. Here are some ways I employ to maintain physical and mental well-being.

A good way to maintain physical wellbeing is to exercise regularly. You can choose walking over transportation for close distance, or climb stairs instead of taking the lift. You can also choose to join a dance class, or pick a sport of your liking. If you prefer to pick exercise, it is advisable to pick the activities that can work out different part of your body. Swimming, tennis, badminton, yoga are some of the good activities that you can get a good body workout.

Balanced diet is another way to maintain physical well-being. It is not advisable to consume junk food and processed food all the time. Eat fresh and different-coloured fruits and vegetables instead. In contrast to junk food, which often carries lots of calories and fats, fruits and vegetables provide more fibre, minerals, and vitamins. In addition to types of food, it is also important to take food in moderate amount. Do not eat excessive amount of food even if the food is tasteful and healthy in terms of nutrition.

In addition to physical well-being, maintaining mental health is equally important. The best-recommended way to maintain mental health is by staying positive. To stay positive, you need to purge negativity from yourself by looking for the bright side of things and focusing on solutions to problems. To avoid being influenced, you also need to purge negative people from your life.

  I think it is a good idea to install a surveillance system at workplace because it provides a reliable and convenient way to curb crimes, protect employees, and improve productivity at workplace.

In my company, there are three types of surveillance systems. There is CCTV in the main office, warehouse, and retail outlets. There is also a card-swipe machine for controlling access to the office. GPS is installed to monitor the movements of vehicles.

In my opinion, with the development of technology, it is predictable that the jobs related to workplace automation and human development will become more popular in the future. Software developers, for example, will be in demand because automation devices all need softwares to function. Cyber security engineers will be in high demand also because businesses will need them to provide sophisticated protection for the data that is vital to the success of business in future. With mundane and repetitive job being taken over by robots, people would have more time and resources to develop themselves. Therefore, it is quite likely that human development jobs such as teacher, trainer, counsellor, mental therapist, artist, and the like will be in high demand also.

<dt>If your current job is not line with trends, will you change it? Why or why not?</dt>
<dd>
My current job is not line with this trend, but I will not change my job. One reason is that I have worked on this position for many years and become seasoned. If I change to other trendy job, the experience I accumulated on my current job will become useless. And, it is not easy to make a mid-career change. Another reason is that I am well-paid on my current position. I am afraid that I won't be able to earn a decent pay if I change to other job and start from entry-level. Nevertheless, I still need to upskill myself so that I can adapt to the latest technology changes at workplace.

<dt>What do you think is the most competitive field or industry to work in? Why?</dt>
<dd>
I think cybersecurity will be the most competitive field to work in. This is because collecting, sharing, and using data will become dominant part of business practices. To protect the critical systems and sensitive data from digital attacks, businesses will have to invest more in cybersecurity.

<dt>Discuss the life issue: My future starts when I wake up every morning... Every day I find something  creative to do with my life.</dt>
<dd>

I believe this quote is talking about the importance of being creative. It tells us that each day can be another chance to be creative. And, if we do something special in every single day, our lives can become pleasant and fulfilling. 

When we think of creativity, we tend to relate it to artists, scientists, or somebody great. But actually, every one of us can be creative and we can be creative in everthing we do.  Take daily routines for example. In our daily life, we often find it easy to fall into rut as our days are filled with unvaried routines and repetitive tasks.  We can take a break and think about what we are doing. Can we do it in another way?  Is there a way to do it that would be more fun or more effective? By seeing the tasks in different ways, we can break routines and perk our lives up.

We can also express our creativity when we are faced with problems. Many years ago when my wife gave birth to my first son, I was forced to reorder my daily routines. At first, I was perturbed that my smooth routine was uprooted. But I soon found the change refreshing. I discovered the places where I was wasting time. I started to get my work done earlier in the evening so that I can find more time in the morning to cook for my wife. I got a strong sense of efficacy when I found that I could solve the problem by managing time more efficiently.

To conclude, creativity is an integral part of life. We can have a creative life as long as you are willing to challenge your old beliefs and habits about how things should be done, and look at them from different perspective.

<dt>Have you ever done something similar to these Cuban doctors of your own free will? Why did you want to do this?</dt>
<dd>
Yes. Many years ago, I had volunteered to teach in a rural area for 1 year. The reason I was willing to do this was because I thought it was meaningful to help the children lived in rural area where was lack of access to education resources.

<dt>Describe a time in your life when you could say 'Every cloud has a silver lining'.</dt>
<dd>
In January 2020, my friend and I booked a flight to Wuhan. Unfortunately I missed the flight because I waked up too late on the day. But every cloud has a silver lining. Because I missed the flight, I did not have to be quarantined in Wuhan where was locked down due to the outbreak of Covid-19.
