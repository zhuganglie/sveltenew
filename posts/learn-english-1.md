<dt>What qualities do you usually look for in a product? </dt>
<dd>
<p>Nowadays, consumers are becoming more and more aware of the importance of product quality though they may have different views about what constitute good quality of a product. The following are what I usully look for when deciding to pay for a product.</p>

<p>First, a good product must be able to fulfill a personal need. When I buy a mobile phone, I expect it to enable me to contact my friend whenever I need to.</p>

<p>Second, a good product must be reliable. It is quite irritating that a product you bought ocaasionally failed to do what it is supposed to do.</p>

<p>Third, a product of good quality must be durable and solid. A well-known difference between branded product and conterfeit product is that branded product, which is made of solid material, is much more lasting than fake product that is of inferior quality.</p>

<p>There are some other qualities one can look for in a product, such as serviceability and aesthetics, but the above-mentioned three are the most important qualities I like to see when making a purchase.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Do you think commercials can really affect behavior of buyers? Why or why not?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Businesses have invested considerable resources into advertisement, creating hype and halo around their brands. Although smart consumers figure out various ways to unscramble the magic, commercials remain effective in fluencing consumer behavior.</p>

<p>First of all, consumers are human beings. They are as emotional as they are rational. Marketters can use irrational advertising techniques to exert influence on the emotional side of human characters. For example, a shoe brand can stir up urgence to buy among consumers by advertising a new model that is for market testing purpose as limited edition.</p>

<p>Moreover, various data analysis techniques have made it much easier for markettiers to accurately identify consumer preference than before. With deep understanding of consumer preference, markettiers are able to engineer or optimize commercials in ways that communicate product features more appealingly to targeted audients.</p>

<p>In short, there are many ways by which commercials can really affect consumer behavior. </p>
</dd>

<dt>Do you think the quality of a product depends on how it is advertised? Why or why not?</dt>
<dd>  
<p>In my opinion, a heavily advertised product is likely to be of better quality.</p>

<p>It has been found that many brands have turned to new promotional tactics, focusing commercials more on quality image of brand than on features of its product. A local shoe brand, for example, named its brand as "Everbest", conveying that their quality is <em>always</em> the best in the market. If a business is willing to invest so much in creating a branded image, it is reasonable to believe that the business is serious about product quality and willing to invest efforts in improving product quality.</p>

<p>Additionally, product quality is a multi-demensional concept. Whether ot not a product is of good quality depends on how you define quality. For this reason, a well engineered advertising may educate its targeted group and construct a new way to perceive good product. Take durability of fashion prodcut for example. A fashion brand, which targets at low-income group, advertised its brand as "leading the fast-paced fashion". With such notion in mind, durability will be construed as "uneasy to follow the fast pace of fashion". Instead, consumers will perceive "cheap", which means easy to make change, as the most important quality.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Tell
me about your experience of being in a place where there was happiness and a
good work-life balance. How
did you feel about it? Why do you
think people feel so overworked or stressed? </dt>
<dd>
<p>I work for a local retail company as a sales manager. My daily routine is to visit the retail outlets and help resolve problems in order for them to hit their monthly targets. This is great because I do not have to clock in and out every day. As there is no clear office hours, I can easily take some time to prepare dinner for my family and schedule appointment when necessary.</p>

<p>Another reason I like the job is that the job is full of challenge. I need to analyse problems, advise team members, and propose business solutions to improve sales revenue. This provides a good opportunity to develop problem-solving, teamwork, and leadership skills. I feel a strong sense of achievement when I see a report that shows great sales performance.</p>

<p>A sales manager tends to be overworked or stressed because they are multi-tasked and often burn candle at both ends. My way to avoid being worn out is to maintain a positive attitude to challenges and to manage time effectively by prioritzing tasks.</p>

<dt>Describe table manners in your family. What food is usually eaten every meal in your family?</dt>
<dd>
<p>I am from a Chinese family and the table manner in my family is quite straightforward. To follow good hygiene, we often wash hands before taking dinner. We need to show respect to the seniors, so we often let the most senior members sit and eat first. We are not allowed to use our hands to handle food. If the food is too difficult to be handled by chopstics, we can use spoon or knife instead. Leaving chopstics on the top of bowl means "having finished". Instead, if we put chopstics on the side of bowl, it means "taking a break from eating".</p>

<p>We have a variety of food for dinner. Rice is usually eaten every meal as main food though we occasionally eat noodles and dumplings. In addition, vegetables are also eaten every meal to keep dinners healthy.</p>

<p>Putting chopstics vertically stuck in a bowl of rice is considered as a bad manner because it symbolizes the ritual of incense burning. It is also quite impolite to point chopstics to any other sitting around, because it means you see others as your "dish".</p>

<dt>What sort of professional achievements have you accomplished?</dt>
<dd>
<p>My greatest professional achievement has been developing up a productive sales force for my company, which resulted in 30% increase in annual sales revenue. This was a great achievement because the company sales had been stagnant for many years before I joined the company.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Did you have to overcome challenges in order to achieve your goals?</dt>
<dd>
<p>I would say it was not easy to achieve that much increase in sales. I had to overcome a number of challenges. </p>
<p>First, there was no budget for me to do advertisement. Second, the sales team was a little bit aged and it was uneasy to hire young people because at that time no young people have interest working in retail line. Last but not least, many of the sales associates were digruntled employees with negative attitude toward work. </p>
<p>To overcome the challenges, I focused my work on developing sales team. I firstly organized a series of training to improve sales and service skills. And at the same time, I tried to instill positive way of thinking into the sales associates. Most importantly, I deviced a variety of incentive programs, which were effective in motivating sales staff. My effort paid off. The company finally saw continuous improvement in sales.</p>
</dd>
<dt>What are most you most proud of?</dt>
<dd>
<p>What I am most proud of is I was promoted to the position of sales operation manager. As mentioned above, I had demonstrated strong ability to develop and lead a team. I had also shown a positive attitude toward work. With strong work ability and positive attitude, I was able to excel in the position and reap the benefits.</p>

<dt>Describe the picture you see.</dt>
<dd>
<p>This picture shows a cultural event organized by Indians in a big playground.</p>

<p>On the left, a man with moustache is selling colorful balloons. He is wearing a yellow short-sleeved shirt and an orange checkered skirt. The balloons he is selling are displayed on a tree-like stand beside him.</p>

<p>A woman in front of the salesman just bought two balloons for her son. The boy is wearing a red checkered shirt and a short in black. His left hand is in his mother' hand, and his right hand is holding the two balloons his mother just bought for him. They are walking toward the big event tents located on the up-left corner of the playground.</p>

<p>Beside the big tents, people are queuing up to enter the tents.</p>

<p>Right beside the big tents, there is also a line of smaller tents decorated in different colors. In each of the small tent, there is a vendor inside selling products and services. People are walking along the small tents, browsing the products displayed inside.</p>

<p>Just behind the line of small tents, there is a big wheel with some big tubs attached to its rim.</p>

<p>On the right side of the picture, there is a big, round platform. A very big tree rooted in the center of the platform. The trunk of the tree is quite big, showing that the tree is likely an old tree. The leaves of the tree, however, are still fresh and green.</p>

<p>Beside the tree, a magician is performing magic. The magician is wearing a traditional indian outfit. He really looks like a magician because of his long beards and moustaches. And the prop on his right hand looks quite strange also. A a group of audients in differrent ages are sitting around the platform and watching his performance.</p>

<p>A signage board is standing beside the platform, showing what the performance is about.</p>

<dt>Tom: Hi, welcome to the chat group. What do you think of the future of the voice-activated devices in the workplace?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Me: Hi Tom. Hi everyone. Voice-activation is a cutting-edge technology. It's quite likely that voice-activated devices will be widely used to automate the business processes in workplace. Take retail shop for example, in future we will see voice-activated robots serve customer in shops. And, storemen in warehouse won't have to do physical jobs any longer. They just need to give instructions and the voice-activated robots will carry the instructions out.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Mary: Hi everyone. What is the possibility of technology continuing development?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Me: That's an interesting question. I personally think that if technology continues development, most of the technical and physical jobs will be automated or mechanised. This must be a good news because human being will be free from life-burden and thus having time and resources to develop humanity.</p>

<p>The picture shows what a passive life style typically looks like.</p>

<p>In the picture, a young man is lying on a sofa with his head propped in the palm of his left hand. He looks bored and dispirited as he keeps switching TV channels with the remote control in the palm of his right hand.</p>

<p>The young man did not (maybe never) cook for himself, but ordered pizza and popcorn from a fast food restaurant. Obviously, he eats neither to keep fit nor for pleasure, but merely to get himself out of hunger. There are some empty beer bottles on the table in front of him. It is likely that he needs beer or alcohol to help alleviate his negative mood.</p>

<p>Probably because he rarely exercises, he is overweight and looks fat. His big tummy remains exposed even he is wearing a large size T shirt.</p>

<p>Living an inactive life style may jeopardize your health. It may cause physical and mental diseases. The best way to avoid being caught in passive life style is to stand up and do something meaningful.</p>

Mr. Chow wants the family to go hiking in the morning, visit Musems in the afternoon, and have a barbecue on the beach in the evening. He is worried about spending too much money. Mrs. Chow thinks her husband worries too much about money. She wants him to relax and forgot about money while they are on vacation.</em></p>

<dt>What should Mrs. Chow do? How can she solve her problem?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Mr. Chow seems to be in a dilemma. On the one hand, he wants his family to have a wonderful vacation; but on the other hand, he is afraid to spend too much.</p>

<p>If I were Mrs. Chow, I would tell Mr. Chow that we should prioritize happiness over others while on vacation. We don't have to worry about spending too much because we can save money by spending smarter. We can list out all the items that each everyone of us wants to do. After assessing the price-benefit ratio of the items, we can remove some items with lower value from the list. Moreover, as the room we rented has a kitchen, we can prepare food by ourselves before going out. Additionally, we can plan our trip route and use public transportation instead of taking taxi. Lastly, we can reschedule our trip and avoid visiting the popular sites on weekends when the fees are higher.</p>

<p>In short, Mrs. Chow can solve her problem by discussing with her family for an optimal trip plan.</p>

Marty seems to be in a dilemma. He likes to be a cab driver but he is overworked and no longer be able to get a sense of satisfaction on the job. 

If I were Marty, I would re-skill myself and seek to transition to new job. Actually, I am quite pessimistic about the future of cab driver job. News report on technology has it that driverless vehicles are already in production. With autonomous vehicles taking over driving, cab driver as a job is bound to disappear sooner or later. 

The arrival of autonomous vehicles, however, will also create new job opportunities while transforming the traditional. For instance, with taxi service being replaced by driverless cars, there must be increasing demand for driverless vehicle dispatchers and safety maintenance technicians. 

Drivers like Marty do not have to feel like in a quandary. They can take training courses, retool their skillset, and get themselves ready to embrace the new opportunities.

<dl>
<dt>After thinking about their job offer, you have decided to reject the offer. Tell the company which proposed the offer to you, about your decision.</dt>
<dd>Thank you for offer me the role of operation manager. But I decided to turn it down, because I had accepted a position with another company. I enjoyed our conversations and appreciated your taking time to interview me. Thank you so much for your consideration.</dd>
<dt>Describe a situation that led you to have to make a difficult choice. How did you feel about it? What are important factors to think about before making a decision?</dt>
<dd>

Mr. Jackson is a salesperson in my sales team. One day, his supervisor complained to me that he could not work with Jackson any longer. This is not the first time I received complaint about Jackson's bad work attitude. Actually his recalcitrance has caused a lot of troubles and been a source of complaints.

However, to sack him or to keep him is not an easy decision to make because Jackson is unquestionably brilliant in sales. I feel like I am between a rock and a hard place. If I kick him out, the outlet sales will drop. If I keep him in, the teamwork will be impaired.

To get out of the dilemma, I saught advice from my boss. He told me that, "Nobody is irreplaceable. Brilliant jerks are costly. If you tolerate them, the cost to effective teamwork will become unacceptably high."

I have to say, my boss's advice is insighful and helpful.
