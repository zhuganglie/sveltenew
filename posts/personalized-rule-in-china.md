**Research Question:** 

How can we explain the resurgence of personalized rule under Xi Jinping in China, despite decades of institutionalized collective leadership established following the Deng Xiaoping era?

**Literature Review:**

The post-Mao era in China, ushered in by Deng Xiaoping, was characterized by a deliberate shift away from personalized rule and towards a more collective leadership model.  Scholars such as Li (2001) and Shambaugh (2008) argue that this institutionalized collective leadership was designed to prevent the return of Maoist-style cult of personality and ensure stability through consensus-based decision-making within the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). This system emphasized term limits, age limits, and a distribution of power among the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC).

However, under Xi Jinping, China appears to be experiencing a shift back towards personalized rule.  This is evidenced by the abolition of term limits, the consolidation of power within the party and military, and the pervasive propaganda promoting Xi's image and ideology (Pei, 2016; McGregor, 2017).  This shift has sparked debate amongst scholars.  Some argue that Xi's consolidation of power is a necessary response to internal and external challenges (Miller, 2018), while others see it as a dangerous trend towards authoritarianism (Nathan, 2019).

**Theoretical Framework:**

This paper utilizes a neo-institutionalist framework to understand the dynamics of power within the CCP.  Specifically, we draw on the concept of "path dependency" (Pierson, 2004) to argue that while Deng's reforms established a path towards collective leadership, pre-existing institutional legacies and informal norms within the CCP, combined with specific contextual factors, created opportunities for the re-emergence of personalized rule.  We argue that Xi Jinping has skillfully leveraged these factors to consolidate his power and personalize his rule.

**Hypothesis:**

The resurgence of personalized rule in China under Xi Jinping is a result of the interplay between: (1) **Pre-existing institutional legacies within the CCP**, such as the paramount authority vested in the General Secretary; (2) **Informal norms of personal loyalty and factionalism**; and (3) **Contextual factors**, including perceived economic slowdown, social unrest, and international pressure, which created a demand for strong leadership.

**Research Design:**

This paper employs a qualitative research design utilizing process tracing to examine the trajectory of Xi Jinping's rise to power and the consolidation of his authority.  We analyze primary sources, including official party documents, speeches by Xi Jinping, and CCP pronouncements, as well as secondary sources, such as scholarly articles, news reports, and expert analyses.  This allows for an in-depth understanding of the motivations, strategies, and enabling factors that have contributed to the re-emergence of personalized rule.

**Empirical Evidence:**

* **Institutional Legacies:** The CCP's Leninist structure, despite reforms, still concentrates immense power in the hands of the General Secretary.  Xi has exploited this existing institutional power to centralize decision-making authority and expand his control over key institutions like the military and the propaganda apparatus.  The re-establishment of the Central Leading Group for Comprehensively Deepening Reforms, chaired by Xi himself, illustrates this centralization.

* **Informal Norms:**  Xi has effectively utilized patronage networks and factional alliances to cultivate loyalty and silence dissent within the party.  The anti-corruption campaign, while ostensibly aimed at rooting out corruption, has also served as a tool to purge rivals and consolidate power (Cai, 2017).

* **Contextual Factors:**  The perception of economic slowdown, rising social inequality, and increasing international pressure, particularly from the United States, has created an environment conducive to the acceptance of strong, centralized leadership.  Xi has capitalized on this sentiment, presenting himself as the indispensable leader needed to navigate these challenges and achieve the "China Dream."

**Conclusion:**

The resurgence of personalized rule in China under Xi Jinping is not simply a deviation from the path of collective leadership.  Rather, it is a manifestation of the complex interplay between pre-existing institutional legacies, informal norms, and contextual factors.  While Deng's reforms aimed to institutionalize collective leadership, they did not completely eradicate the underlying structures and norms that facilitated personalized rule.  Xi Jinping has effectively exploited these legacies and vulnerabilities to consolidate his power and re-establish a form of personalized rule reminiscent of the Maoist era.  This trend has significant implications for China's domestic politics, economic development, and foreign policy, and warrants further research and analysis.
