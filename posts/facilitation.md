Here are some points I learnt from a class debate during ACTA training.  

  - Manage tension by balancing the needs of different learners (time vs. interaction)
  - Be committed to the learning of the learners when having fun activities
  - Demonstrate professional value by resolving ethical dilemma properly
  - Manage group discussion and intervene when necessary
  - Trainer is not a content provider but a facilitator who assists the learners to learn effectively
  - Need to manage learners' motivation although adult learners are intrinsically motivated
  - Get the learners ready to start
  - Trainers' role is not to entertain but to engage the learners in learning
  - When giving feedback, be honest but in a constructive and encouraging way
  - Have a built-in retention component
  - Donot feed too much, make sure that the learners are able to pick up
  - Link activities to learning points

In short, we need to manage every components of a class carefully so that the learning outcomes will be achieved in the end.
