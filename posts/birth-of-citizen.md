## Abstract

Claims that China's people are exhibiting a rising “rights consciousness” have become commonplace, with some suggesting this phenomenon is driving political change. Yet it is often unclear what the concept means, leading to ambiguous or contradictory conclusions from field research. In order to create a basis for more systematic analysis, we develop a rational choice framework that characterizes three different factors that could lead to rights-conscious behaviour: changing values, changing government policies, and changing expectations of the behaviour of others. What rising rights consciousness implies for social stability can vary dramatically, depending on which change is at work. Rights consciousness resulting from changes in values or in shared expectations of behaviour is destabilizing for the CCP's continued rule, whereas rights consciousness derived from government policies has a stabilizing effect. While in practice these can be interrelated in complex ways, empirical research would benefit from greater attention to these distinctions.

## Abstract

This article explores the process and causes of the emerging consciousness of citizens’ rights in China. Using data from a nationally representative survey on the current state of fairness and justice in China in 2014, it presents an empirical study on the features of the generational variation of Chinese citizens’ emerging rights consciousness as well as the factors that contribute to the variation. Previous research has attributed the rise of citizens’ rights consciousness in China to democratization and political liberalization. In the absence of full democracy in China, however, findings from this article demonstrate that the forces of marketization can directly lead to the awakening of the rights consciousness among Chinese citizens. The article also finds that China’s urbanization process has promoted the generational variation of the citizens’ rights consciousness.

## Abstract
Despite the suppression of the Tiananmen Uprising of 1989, popular protest in China has by all accounts escalated steadily over the ensuing two decades. These protests have spread to virtually every sector of Chinese society, prompting more than a few observers to proclaim the emergence of a “rising rights consciousness” that poses a protodemocratic challenge to the authority and durability of the Communist state. This essay proposes instead that what we are seeing in China today reflects a much older rules consciousness, in which savvy protesters frame their grievances in officially-approved terms in order to negotiate a better bargain with the authoritarian state.

## Abstract
Research on protests and social movements in China has mushroomed alongside the rising occurrences of mass incidents. What drives up citizens’ protest potential, however, has led to two competing theories: the “rights consciousness” view and the “rules consciousness” view. By fitting structural equation model on a nationally representative survey dataset, this paper specifies and estimates these two competing explanations of an individual’s protest potential. This paper finds that rights consciousness drives up individuals’ propensity to protest, whereas rules consciousness depresses it. Furthermore, this paper shows latent measures/social values instead of explicit measures/political values to be effective predictors of protest potential. These research findings have important implications for comparative research on the relationship between values and political behavior in authoritarian regimes beyond the China case.
